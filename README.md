# Electricity Consumption and Billing Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes electricity consumption and billing data to understand usage
patterns, billing behavior, and tariff impacts. The analysis combines Excel-based
data validation with Python-based exploratory data analysis and machine learning.

## Dataset
The dataset contains monthly electricity consumption and billing information,
including:
- Month
- City
- Units_Consumed
- TariffRate
- Electricity_Bill

The raw dataset was cleaned manually in Excel for quick validation, and the cleaned
CSV file was used for analysis and modeling in Python.

## Tools & Technologies
- Excel (data cleaning and validation)
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook
- Git & GitHub

## Analysis Performed
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to study consumption and billing trends
- Visualization of monthly average electricity usage and bills
- Analysis of the relationship between units consumed and electricity bills

## Machine Learning Models
### Linear Regression
Used to model and predict electricity billing based on units consumed.

### KMeans Clustering
Applied to segment consumers based on electricity usage and billing behavior.

## Key Insights
- Electricity bills increase with higher consumption, but not always linearly.
- Monthly averages reveal seasonal patterns in usage and billing.
- Clustering identifies distinct consumer segments with similar usage behavior.

## Limitations
- Dataset size is limited.
- Demographic and household-level details were not available.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates a complete data analysis workflow, from data cleaning
and visualization to predictive modeling and consumer segmentation.
